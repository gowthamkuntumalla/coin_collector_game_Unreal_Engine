# coin_collector by Gowtham Kuntumalla

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.  It is a simple fun to play game! 


Goal: 

1. Power (aka health of coin_man) is going down every second. 

2. Pick up coins so that power (blue bar) doesn't go to zero. 

3. Stay alive as long as you can!!

Once dead, game restarts. Watch out for the ragdoll effect when coinman runs out of power.

It has objects that user can climb user like stairs, cones, blocks etc. 


Works on Mac (Not tested on Windows/Ubuntu)
